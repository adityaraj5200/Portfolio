# 📘 **Personal Portfolio — Full Stack Project (Java + Spring Boot + React)**

This repository contains the **complete source code of my personal portfolio website**, built as a **production-style full-stack project** with a strong focus on **backend engineering**.

The goal of this project is not just to showcase information, but to **demonstrate real backend system design using Java & Spring Boot**, supported by a modern frontend.

---

## 🏗 **Project Architecture**

```
root-repo/
│
├── backend/     → Java + Spring Boot REST API
└── frontend/    → React + Tailwind Portfolio UI
```

* The **backend is a fully independent REST API** built using **Spring Boot**.
* The **frontend is a modern React application** that consumes JSON content for different sections of my portfolio.
* Both are **decoupled deliberately** to ensure:

  * Fast frontend load time (no cold starts)
  * Independent backend demo for credibility
  * Clean separation of concerns

## 🎯 **Why This Project Exists**

After working as an **SDE-1 at Amazon**, I wanted a portfolio that:

* Proves my **backend engineering skills**
* Reflects real **production-style system design**
* Goes beyond static HTML pages
* Acts as a **live technical proof**, not just a resume link

This repository serves as:

* A **demonstration of my Java + Spring Boot expertise**
* A **real full-stack engineering project**
* A **live system recruiters can inspect**
